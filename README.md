# SportsTeamNameGenerator
Generate a rather silly sports team name.

Example:

let generateSportsTeamName = require('./sportsTeamNameGenerator.js')
let teamName = generateSportsTeamName()


The functions is in the bottom of the sportsTeamNameGenerator.js file. It is very is easy to tweak the output. Support for ES6 modules is not included, but easy enough to put in yourself if needed.
